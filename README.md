JavaScript-Roguelike
====================

A single screen roguelike written in Javascript, made pretty by CSS.

I worked on this over the summer, and used this as a way to get some experience in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

It runs best in Chrome, and when playing, try out the "h" help menu for instructions
